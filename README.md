# Hyperbee JS's implementation details

There is little or no documentation on Hyperbee's implementation, but we need to understand this in order to reach parity with it.

Hyperbee is an implementation of a [B-Tree](#TODO) onto an [Append-only log](#TODO).
There are several ways to do this.

Each `Hyperbee.put` is written as *one* "block" onto the Hypercore.
Each block on the hypercore correspond to the `Node` message in protobuf definition file ([`schema.proto`](#TODO)).

A `Node` has a "key", a list  of "TreeNode" data, and optionally a "value".
The terminology here is a bit confusing: Node vs TreeNode,  a "key" has a "key" and a "value"
TreeNode is, in HyperbeeJS, a node in the btree datastructure.
Node is the name of the thing a hypercore block can deserialize into, which contains a list of data for TreeNodes.

## Testing

Integration test data is generated by the the code in `gen_test_data`. Generate the test data with:
```
$ cd gen_test_data && yarn install && yarn node index.js && popd
```

Then you can run the tests with `$ cargo test`.
