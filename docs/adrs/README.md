# Architectural Decision Records

Inspired by [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/blob/1e2b046be1b87d5c92d8952fb051b7c84f8ae4d3/docs/adr/README.md), this directory contains a series of [Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/)
or "ADRs" for the this project.

These are historical references that do not supersede (but might enhance) the living documentation of the project itself, which you can find inline in the source code.

Proposing a non-trivial change? You might like to start with an ADR by copying template.md into a new file, filling out a first version of the proposal, and posting it as a PR on the github repo for discussion.
